COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: BHARANIDHARAN

INTERN ID: CT08OPX

DOMAIN: VLSI

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

OVERVIEW:
  This project involves designing a Basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that supports the following operations:

    Addition (+)
    Subtraction (-)
    AND (&)
    OR (|)
    NOT (~)
  The ALU is implemented using Verilog/VHDL and includes a testbench for validation. A simulation report is also provided to demonstrate the correctness of the design.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:
  Implement the ALU using Verilog/VHDL.
  Design a testbench to validate functionality.
  Simulate the ALU and generate a report.
DELIVERABLES:
  ✅ ALU Verilog/VHDL Code
  ✅ Testbench for Verification
  ✅ Simulation Report
